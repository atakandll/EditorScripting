<details><summary> What is Editor Scripting? 
  
Editor Scripting can help you customize and extend the Unity editor to make it easier to use on your projects. This repository covers the basics of editor scripting, including building custom inspectors, gizmos, and other Editor windows.

## Inverse Kinematic:
 Inverse kinematic is the process of calculating rotations for a set of joins in order to make the final joint reach same position. Calculate the rotations for shoulders, elbows and wrist which are required for the fingers to reach a point in space.

 There are one example of inverse kinematic example in this project. I used Animation rigger package for the rigging. Open the InverseKinematic scene in project.
